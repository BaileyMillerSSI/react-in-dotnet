# ReactJS.Net
## Getting started
This approach will not be completed because the project ReactJS.Net is no longer in active development. As such I cannot recommend anyone using it for production code or in a new project. See [#1315](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/1315)

## Results


## Pros
- Offers the promise of server side rendering inside of a single C# application

## Cons
- Maintenance mode
- Docs are nearly impossible to read
- Examples are far and few between

## Overall option
Do not use this library unless you have an edge case that requires it. As mentioned in the post above the project is no longer maintained and will not keep up with newer React features.
